***Describe defense in depth***

Defense in depth uses a layered approach to security, rather than relying on a single perimeter.

A defense in-depth strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advance of an attack.

* Physical security such as limiting access to a datacenter
* Identity and access security controls
* Perimeter security of network, DDos protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users.
* Network security, network segmentation and limit communication.
* Compute layer security, closing ports.
* Application layer security to ensure applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilities.
* Data layer security, encryption
